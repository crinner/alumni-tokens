    <h3 class="w3-wide">Alumni Connection and Engagement Services for Colleges and Universities</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">Welcome to alumni-tokens.com, offering alumni connection and engagement services for colleges and universities using blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Our philosophy includes:</p>
    <ul class="w3-left-align fa-ul">
         <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Engage with alumni in a respectful, mutually beneficial way</li>
         <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Manage alumni connections at the program or department level (subsidiarity principle)</li>
         <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Connect alumni relations and university advancement</li>
         <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Focus on benefits to current students</li>
         <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square"></i>Assist your existing team - no outsourcing, no personal data sharing</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="w3-justify">If you are an alum, check in with your former professors at college or university - they will love to hear from you! Ask them whether the institution is considering to engage with alumni in new ways and could benefit from our services.</p>
    <!--p class="w3-justify"></p-->

  <!-- Services -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="services">
    <h3 class="w3-wide">Our Services</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">We work collaboratively with alumni relations and other relevant units to identify opportunities specific to each client. We would also gladly work on small exploratory projects with individual departments/institutes/schools. We are in the process of developing an array of services as follows:</p>
    <ul class="w3-ul w3-left-align w3-hoverable">
      <li>Free one-time consultation</li>
      <li>Bag of generic alumni tokens and training</li>
      <li>Custom token design and training</li>
      <li>Development and implementation of alumni outreach strategy</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="w3-justify">An initial free consultation (Zoom call) is highly recommended to ensure project effectiveness. An entry-level package consists of a "bag" of ALUM and ALMA tokens (see below) and training on how to distribute them technically, as well as suggestions for specific use cases, including distribution to alumni, graduating students, current students, and prospective students, as well as to government and industry contacts, guest speakers, and donors. We can also design custom tokens and provide the same individualized training and recommendations for these. Lastly, we would be happy to develop and assist with the implementation of your broader alumni outreach strategy along the principles stated in the introduction.</p>

  <!-- ALUM -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="alum">
    <h3 class="w3-wide">The ALUM Token</h3>
    <img src="icons/alum.png" width=128 alt="Icon for the ALUM token">
    <p class="w3-justify">Hand out the ALUM token to your graduating students and alumni in recognition of their academic achievement. Expose your graduates to the cryptocurrency world and encourage them to hold or use their tokens. Possible uses include exchanging them with peers or contributing them back to their program, department, or university, for example as "payment" for alumni event attendance.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Technically, the ALUM token uses the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain and Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). An identical token was also generated on the Stellar (XLM) blockchain. Both blockchains are characterized by fast transactions and low fees. The Stellar blockchain additionally involves lower energy costs than the Bitcoin family of blockchains.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The ALUM token has an initial supply of one million units for experimentation; additional units will be minted for new clients. Recipients will need to install a free BCH/SLP "wallet" in order to store their allocations. Please note that the unlimited total supply means that it is unlikely that this token will reach significant monetary value.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- ALMA -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="alma">
    <h3 class="w3-wide">The ALMA Token</h3>
    <img src="icons/alma.png" width=128 alt="Icon for the ALMA token">
    <p class="w3-justify">Use the ALMA token to supplement the ALUM token vis-a-vis graduates and alumni. You can pair ALUM and ALMA or let your graduates choose among them. While ALMA can stand for the female form, alumna, it was primarily developed for use by the institution itself, the alma mater, "an allegorical Latin phrase for a university, school, or college that one formerly attended" (Wikipedia). Give ALMA as a thank-you to professionals giving guest lectures to your students, or set ALMA achievement levels in exchange for monetary donations from the community. Also do not forget your faculty and staff as possible recipients of ALMA recognition!</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The details of the ALMA token are identical to those of the ALUM token, although they are not linked in a technical sense.</p>
